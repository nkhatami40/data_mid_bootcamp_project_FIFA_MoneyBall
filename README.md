# data_mid_bootcamp_project_FIFA_MoneyBall

FIFA 21 is an association football simulation video game.The datasets provided include the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 21. The dataset includes 107 features and 17125 rows!


# Challenges
The challenges in this project include performing an end-to-end analysis to analyze this large dataset and applying statistical or machine learning techniques to assess this dataset!

# Questions to be answered
In this project, 2 questions will be answered by using machine learning analysis. The questions include:
1- In which clubs do the best players play?
2- Which club has the highest number of best players among top 20 teams?

#Prediction of a numerical target
The second task that must be done in this project is defining a numerical target and predicting its values using linear regression algorithm. 
In this project, the age of the best players was chosen as the numerical target to be predicted.  


#Tools
EDA was used to answer the 2 first questions. Using functions such as value_counts() and sort_values() besides the plot bars were very helpful for answering these wuestions.

To answer the second questions, removing highly correlated columns and box cox transformation were used to predict the target and increase the statistical metrics after applying linear regression.
